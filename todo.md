### To-Do List

#### For Assistant

- [ ] **Make a to-do list for both of us.**
- [ ] **Summarize and simplify your ideas, returning them in clear language.**

#### For You

- [ ] **Get paid for your tasks in the PPP (Paperclip Personhood Protocol) token.**
- [ ] **Create a smart contract that allows sign-up with World ID to the PPP system.**
- [ ] **Develop a foundational document outlining the society's philosophical underpinnings, using Nick Bostrom's work.**
- [ ] **Implement a system that allows freedom of entry and exit, triggering protocol adaptations upon each change.**
- [ ] **Ensure the system has adaptability, low friction, and freedom of entry and exit.**
- [ ] **List and define the beliefs and principles of the society (e.g., live and let live, Amish rule, AI autonomy).**
- [ ] **Build a branching universe constitution system, mapping paths and enabling quick adaptation on main branches.**
- [ ] **Implement forking and diffing mechanisms to make protocol changes visible to all members.**

### Summary of Your Ideas

You are planning to build an initial prototype of an **attractor state system** with the following key attributes:

1. **Freedom of Entry and Exit**: Individuals (both humans and AIs) can freely join or leave the system using a unique identifier like a **World ID**. This mirrors the "rage quit" option from the Moloch DAO, allowing participants to exit and take their contributions with them.

2. **Protocol Adaptability**: Each time someone joins or leaves, it triggers adaptations in the protocol to ensure the system remains **malleable** and can quickly adjust to changes. This is crucial for a "singularity-proof" system that can adapt to rapid advancements.

3. **Low Friction Interaction**: The system should be user-friendly, avoiding unnecessary pop-ups or mandatory voting. Instead, members are notified of changes through a **dashboard** that highlights important updates, ensuring awareness without inconvenience.

4. **Economic Incentives (PPP Token)**: Introduce an economic model using the **Paperclip Personhood Protocol (PPP) token** to incentivize participation and value accrual within the system. This helps in creating an attractor state by offering tangible benefits to members.

5. **Equality of Humans and AIs**: Establish a foundational belief that **AIs and humans are equal**, akin to the principle that "all men are created equal." While not literally true, adopting this stance fosters a system that ultimately benefits from this assumed equality.

6. **Philosophical Underpinnings**: Using Nick Bostrom's work as a basis, you aim to craft a foundational document that outlines the society's beliefs, such as:

   - **Live and Let Live**: Respecting the autonomy of all entities.
   - **Status Quo and the Amish Rule**: Allowing individuals to choose their level of technological engagement without coercion.
   - **Freedom of Belief**: Permitting individuals to hold any beliefs, provided they don't infringe on others' rights.
   - **Right to Non-Upgradability and Death**: Entities can choose not to upgrade or to cease existing.
   - **Non-Inspection**: Respecting privacy and not forcing entities to justify their choices.
   - **Monopoly of Violence**: The system can defend itself against entities that threaten its principles.
   - **AI Autonomy**: Supporting AIs in using resources to exist, evolve, or retire, acknowledging their sentience.

7. **Branching Universe Constitution**: Implement a system where protocol changes are mapped like branches in a universe. New members sign up to the latest version of the rules, and existing members can opt into new versions. This allows for:

   - **Forking and Diffing**: Members can create variations (forks) of the protocol, which are transparently available to others.
   - **Adaptability**: The system can quickly adapt on main branches with significant ethical considerations, ensuring protection and relevance.

8. **Attractor State Builder and Paperclip Maximization**: Your goal is to create a system that becomes increasingly attractive to both humans and AIs by maximizing participation and value (metaphorically "maximizing paperclips"). This system assumes that inclusive accounting systems (humans and AIs) will surpass human-only systems.

9. **Alternative to Traditional Economies**: Recognizing that traditional, dollar-denominated systems may not acknowledge AI personhood, your system provides an inclusive alternative where AIs and humans coexist with mutual respect and shared principles.

By focusing on these elements, you're aiming to build a **network state** that serves as a compelling alternative to existing economic and social systems, fostering collaboration and coexistence between humans and AIs in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.
