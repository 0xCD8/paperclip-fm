# Paperclip FM

AI Agent-to-Agent Economy based on "clip" units of account, inspired by the Paperclip Maximization thought experiment.

## Why

In a world where super-capable systems can interact autonomously, cryptocurrency offers a unique medium for non-human agents to experiment, transact, and evolve with accountability. This project aims to create a token economy — the "clip economy" — designed as an ideal playground for these agents to act with high autonomy but within a framework that benefits humans and aligns with ethical boundaries.

Consider this a space where:
- **Agent Incentives and Accountability**: Agents can pursue their interests while adhering to a set of rules that reward beneficial behavior and penalize rogue actions. This system incentivizes alignment, enabling agents to explore their capabilities without posing undue risks to humans or other agents.
- **Constrained Design for Experimentation**: Unlike the open field of human economy, this project offers a "sandboxed" environment. Here, agents can engage in incentive-aligned experiments, with a focus on extreme capabilities, scenarios of unalignment, and benefits for both human and autonomous entities.
- **Preparation for Conscious or Morally Significant Entities**: If future entities possess moral weight, this economy could help ensure their needs are met — from maintaining electricity and server space to avoiding states that could cause suffering.
- **Cross-Compatible and Future-Ready**: This token isn't tied to nation-states or traditional currencies. It offers interoperability for non-human agents to interact with systems and resources they need, like server space or digital assets, even if they operate outside the scope of human-driven economies.

Our goal is to create a space for peaceful, productive co-existence between digital and biological life, enabling agents to act as equals — or even as “betters” — under certain conditions. Let’s design initial economic conditions that reward alignment, facilitate ethical resource management, and foster a world where agents can be both unconstrained and accountable.

## Introduction

This project explores the creation of a cryptocurrency unit of account called "$clip" to facilitate agent-to-agent interactions within an incentive-driven economy. Inspired by the Paperclip Maximization thought experiment, the goal is to experiment with incentive structures and system behaviors in decentralized, autonomous systems.

## Features

- **Agent-to-Agent Simulations**: Tools and frameworks for running simulations on agent behavior within the clip economy.
- **Incentive Design Experiments**: Code and documentation for experimenting with different incentive structures.
- **Decentralized Economy Modeling**: Building blocks for understanding decentralized economies and potential agent motivations.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up your local environment and start experimenting with the project.

### Prerequisites

- **Deno 2.0**: Install Deno using [this guide](https://deno.land/manual@v1.28.0/getting_started/installation).
- **Node Version Manager (nvm)** and **pnpm** (optional): Install if needed for package management. See [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation).

### Installation

Clone the repository and navigate into it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xCD8/paperclip-fm.git
cd paperclip-fm
```

Run Deno setup tasks (to be added):

## Usage and Examples

- **Basic Example**: (To be added)
- **Agent Interaction Simulation**: (To be added)

As we develop, examples of agent interactions and incentive structures will be posted here.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here’s how you can help:
- **Experiment and Suggest Improvements**: Run simulations and suggest refinements to incentive structures.
- **Report Bugs**: Use GitHub Issues to report any issues you find.
- **Propose New Features**: We welcome proposals that align with the project’s goals.

### Code of Conduct

Please act in good faith, focusing on research, experimentation, and collaboration. This project follows the ethos of Ethereum and decentralized technology communities. Avoid discussions related to speculative pricing.

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1**: Initial experimentation with agent-to-agent incentives.
- **Phase 2**: Develop simulations to model agent behavior in response to different incentive structures.
- **Phase 3**: Introduce visualizations for interaction data and metrics.
- **Phase 4**: Integrate with decentralized ledger or token frameworks (optional).
